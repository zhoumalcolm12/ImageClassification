How to improve image classification model accuracy while keeping fast-paced data processing speed? What need to do to solve overfitting problem caused by deep learning model without information sacrifice? In this project, we will compare 5 image classification models with different image processing technique and convolutional neural network structure to figure out tools for optimizing performance of image classification model.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.
