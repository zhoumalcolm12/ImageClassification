How to improve image classification model accuracy while keeping fast-paced data processing speed? What need to do to solve overfitting problem caused by deep learning model without information sacrifice? In this project, we will compare 5 image classification models with different image processing technique and convolutional neural network structure to figure out tools for optimizing performance of image classification model.

Here's 5 models included in this project:
* Baseline Model
* Data Augmentation Model
* 3layer CNN Model
* 3layer CNN + Data Augementation Model
* Pretrained Model (VGG16)
